### Hi, I'm Mike

I live and work in the North East of England, as a Senior Software Engineer at [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/).

I have experience working across the full stack but focus primarily on backend development. I enjoy working on infrastructure development, mainly within AWS.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikeshawdev).
